Here a few scripts thats help me in my workprocess!


<h2>PingDigNS:</h2>

Script for fast output 3 console commands: ping, dig ANY, nslookup.
Ping send to server 2 packages
dig ANY returns only sections that matter
nslookup as a dig ANY.

For ease to use i recommend creating alias in .bashrc, example:
alias 'diag'='python3 ~/path/to/script.py'

<h2>Parser.py:</h2>

Parser for reviews on the hosting101.ru. 
Write all reviews in text file that will be created in the same directory where the script is located.
